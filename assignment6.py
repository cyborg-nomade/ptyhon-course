"""Assignment 6

1) Write a short Python script which queries the user for input
(infinite loop with exit possibility) and writes the input to a file.

2) Add another option to your user interface:
The user should be able to output the data stored in the file in the terminal.

3) Store user input in a list (instead of directly adding it to the file)
and write that list to the file â€“ both with pickle and json.

4) Adjust the logic to load the file content to work with pickled/ json data.
